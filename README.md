**Overview:**

This project focuses on using machine learning to classify breast ultrasound images.

---

**Goals:**
- Develop a classification model.

- Perform cross-validation.

- Optimise hyperparameters.

- Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, AUC (ROC and PR curves), precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Visualisations such as confusion matrices and ROC/PR curves to analyze performance.
  
---

**Dataset and Code:**

The BreastMNIST dataset is used, containing 28×28 grayscale images of breast ultrasound scans categorized into two classes:
{’0’: ’**malignant**’, ’1’: ’**normal, benign**’}.

The dataset consists of 546 training images, 78 validation images, and 156 test images.

**Deliverables:**

- A Jupyter notebook with the code for training, evaluation, and visualisation.
- A poster summarising the problem and findings.
